# Election_Analysis

### Helping a Colorado Board of Election representative Tom in a political race review of the arranged outcomes for the U.S. Legislative region in Colorado.

## Overview of Election Audit

### All of this assignment is intended to report the total number of votes cast, the total number of votes for each candidate, the percentage of votes for each candidate, and the election winner based on popular vote. Tom's manager wants to know if there is a way to automate the process using Python. If this audit is successful with Python, this process and code can be used to audit not only other constituencies but also senatorial districts and local elections.
### There are three fundamental democratic techniques: mail polling forms, punch cards and electronic direct record or DRE counting machines. Polling forms sent via mail are typically counted physically at the principle office. Punch cards are gathered and placed into a machine that arranges the absolute votes and sends the outcomes back to the focal office. At last, the memory cards of the DRE counting machines are shipped off the focal and read by the PC. This data is in the [election_results.csv](https://github.com/DougUOT/Election_Analysis/blob/master/Resources/election_results.csv) document. Through and through, the votes cast by these three techniques will decide the end-product of the races. After the votes are counted, the objective is to create a vote count report to confirm the rush to the US Congress.
### The purpose of the project, is that the final code or script developed in Python provides the following information when the script is run in Visual Studio Code or printed to the terminal. The outcomes and data produced in this content were saved in the [election_analysis.txt](https://github.com/DougUOT/Election_Analysis/blob/master/Analysis/election_analysis.txt) record. 

### 1) Calculate the total number of votes cast.
### 2) Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
### 3) Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
### 4) Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
### 5) Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.
